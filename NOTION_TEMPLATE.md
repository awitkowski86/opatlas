## Recommended Page Structure

### 🚀 Hero Section

**Page Title (H1)**: Your Main Value Proposition

*Example:* "Ship Your MVP in 7 Days, Not 7 Months"

**Subtitle (Regular Text)**: 1-2 sentences explaining what you do and who it's for

*Example:* "The fastest way for developers to turn ideas into launched products. Pre-built components, auth, payments, and deployment - all configured."

---

### ✨ Key Benefits (Bullet List)

Use a bulleted list for 3-4 key benefits:

- ⚡ **Lightning fast setup** - Start coding in 5 minutes
- 🔐 **Auth built-in** - Login, signup, and password reset ready
- 💳 **Stripe integrated** - Accept payments from day one
- 🚀 **Deploy anywhere** - Vercel, Netlify, or your own server

---

### 🎯 Problem Statement (Optional)

**Heading:** "Why We Built This"

Write 2-3 paragraphs about the problem you're solving.

*Example:*
"Most developers waste 60% of their time rebuilding the same auth flows, payment systems, and deployment pipelines for every new project.

Meanwhile, your competitors are shipping and getting user feedback.

We built [Product] so you can skip the boilerplate and focus on what makes your idea unique."

## Pro Tips

### Formatting Best Practices

- **Use H1 for your main headline** - This becomes the page title
- **Use bold for emphasis** - Highlights important points
- **Keep paragraphs short** - 2-3 sentences max for web readability
- **Use emojis sparingly** - Adds personality but don't overdo it
- **Include calls-to-action** - Remind readers what action to take

### Content Tips

1. **Lead with benefits, not features** - "Save 40 hours" vs "Includes auth system"
2. **Be specific with numbers** - "7 days" not "fast", "$29" not "affordable"
3. **Address objections** - FAQ section handles common concerns
4. **Create urgency** - Limited spots, early access pricing, launching soon
5. **One clear CTA** - "Join Waitlist" or "Get Lifetime Access"

### What Gets Converted Automatically

✅ **Headings** → Proper semantic HTML (h1, h2, h3)
✅ **Bold/Italic** → Strong emphasis styling
✅ **Links** → Clickable links with hover effects
✅ **Bullet lists** → Formatted checkmarks or bullets
✅ **Numbered lists** → Sequential numbering
✅ **Quotes** → Styled blockquotes
✅ **Code blocks** → Syntax highlighted code
✅ **Images** → Responsive images (if hosted publicly)

### What to Avoid

❌ Complex nested pages (use single page)
❌ Notion databases (not supported yet)
❌ Private images (must be publicly accessible)
❌ Embedded content from other services
❌ Toggle lists (export as regular lists)
